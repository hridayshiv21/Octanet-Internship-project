# Octanet-Internship-project
This Project is part of my web development intern Journey at Octanet.
 This project allowed me to apply my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while exploring various APIs to fetch real-time weather data.
The WeatherWeb app is designed to provide you with up-to-date weather information for any location around the globe. With a clean and intuitive user interface, 
it offers a seamless experience for users to check the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and even a five-day forecast.
